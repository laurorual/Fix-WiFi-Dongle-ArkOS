Fortunately for you, the user u/JuniperSkunktaur on Reddit has found a solution!
The problem tho, is that you must connect a keyboard on your device and type things on a terminal, inside your device, which for a lot of people is kinda hard.

By using this script, you can fix your dongle on your device by just copying a single file to your SD and running it!

Thanks for the user mr.yoritoshi for testing the script and seeing if it works!

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the "setup_usb_modeswitch.sh" from the releases tab, and copy it to the "tools" folder of your microSD card.
2. Insert the microSD back to your device, turn it on and head to the "Tools" category, where you will find "setup_usb_modeswitch.sh" in it.
3. Run the script by pressing A on it and wait until it finishes the patches.
4. After that, it is recommended that you shut down your device, plug your dongle and turn it on again, and that's it!

Enjoy finally having cheap wifi on your device!
